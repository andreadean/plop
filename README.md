# plop
Chrome extension to change "pool" to "poker" and "poker" to "pool"

# why?
In what is commonly reffered to as "pool," you poke the balls. In so-called "poker," money is pooled. Go ahead and [try it out, or at least read the great reviews](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/pool-to-poker-and-poker-t/lndkcaldfpakdjdjgdpchoohjnbaaohk?hl=en)!

# warning
If this extension is enabled, this page may look strange.
